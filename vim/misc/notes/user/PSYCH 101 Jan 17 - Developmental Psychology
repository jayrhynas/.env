PSYCH 101 Jan 17 - Developmental Psychology

# Different Views of Development
 • ontogenetic
    ◦ individual species members
    ◦ development across life span
       ▸ infancy → childhood → adolescence → adulthood → old age
    ◦ developmental psychology is often split into cognitive development and social/personality development
    ◦ lectures focus on ontogenetic development in young childeren
 • phylogenetic
    ◦ evolution of mind & behaviour over long periods of time
    ◦ comparative psychology - comparing across species
    ◦ evolutionary psychology
       ▸ how did our psychology evolve due to the environment (African Savanna) where we evolved
 • cultural
    ◦ “primitive” vs “advanced” - Anthropological Psychology
    ◦ modes of though developed as we moved from stone → bronze → iron → ... → modern ages etc
    ◦ how does literacy affect how we think
    ◦ how do economic and political factors influence development

# Nature and Nurture
 • Galton - cousin of Darwin
    ◦ believed that people are not born as a blank slate
    ◦ no matter how you’re raised, you’ll grow up into a certain person, decided at birth
 • Perspectives on Nature vs Nurture
    ◦ opposition
       ▸ many people are strongly on one side or the other (nature vs nurutre)
    ◦ independence
       ▸ some people believe both contribute, but are independent (nature and nurture)
    ◦ interdependence
       ▸ both have effect, and interact with each other (nature with nurture)

# Genes & Environment
 • genotype - biological potential
 • phenotype - actualized potential
    ◦ influenced by environment
    ◦ phenotype != genotype
       ▸ two people might have the same phenotype (brown eyes) but different genotypes (one has Brown-Brown genes, one has Blue-Brown genes)
       ▸ or two people may have the same genotype but different phenotypes
 • types of environments
    ◦ prenatal environment - environment during fetal development
       ▸ less variable, still has influence
    ◦ perinatal - environment at time of birth
    ◦ postnatal - environment after birth (and for the rest of life)

# Cognitive Development
 • Jean Piaget - father of cognitive development
    ◦ development occurs in stages
    ◦ progress between stages by mastering certain concepts
 • 4 stages of development (Piaget)
    ◦ sensorimotor (birth - 2 years)
       ▸ based on senses - seeing & feeling
       ▸ period in which infants understanding of the world is based on sensory input and motion (see text for full def.)
       ▸ biggest milestone: object perminance
          ▹ understanding that objects still exist when they aren’t being seen or touched
    ◦ preoperational (2 - 7 years)
       ▸ understanding symbols, pretend play
       ▸ mastering the concept of “conservation”
          ▹ the knowledge that the quantity or amount of an object is not related to its physical arrangement
          ▹ ex: put same amnt of water in 2 glasses, one short and fat, one tall and narrow
             ▪ if you don’t understand “conservation”, you’d say the tall, narrow glass has more water
    ◦ concrete operational (7 - 11 years)
       ▸ develop skills in using & manipulating numbers, more logic
       ▸ classify objects based on properties such as size, shape, value, etc
       ▸ transitivity - if a > b and b > c, then a > c
    ◦ formal operational (11+)
 • emerging research
    ◦ Piaget did most of his work before 1970
    ◦ false belief research
       ▸ theory of mind - understanding that different individuals have different mental states & beliefs
       ▸ give a 2yr old child goldfish crackers and brocolli
          ▹ ask them to eat something, they eat crackers
          ▹ ask them to give you something you like, they give you goldfish
          ▹ show that you really like brocolli, then ask for something → they still give you goldfish
          ▹ 3yr old → gives you goldfish, but then gives you brocolli after you show you like it
