PSYCH 101 Jan 22 - Developmental Psychology (Continued)

# Cognitive Development (Continued)
 • emerging research (continued)
    ◦ false belief research (continued)
       ▸ tell a kid this story:
          ▹ Sally has a cupcake. She and Anne want to go play so Sally hides the cupcake in the cupboard. But when they’re outside, Anne comes back inside and puts the cupcake in the oven.
       ▸ ask the kid, where will Sally look for the cupcake
          ▹ < 4 years old will usually say the oven - they don’t understand that people’s beliefs don’t necessarily match the truth
       ▸ same experiment, but with an eye-tracking story book, the younger kids will look at the cupboard first before answering oven - they’re thinking about it
    ◦ probability
       ▸ mix 10 blue and 2 red marbles in a bag, ask a kid what will come out
          ▹ they usually say random, even though blue is more likely
    ◦ looking time research
       ▸ used with very young children/babies
       ▸ draw conclusions based on how long they look at something
 • recap
    ◦ Piaget: inspired research in cognitive development
       ▸ wasn’t always right, especially with age ranges, but that was mostly due to lack of technology/methodology
       ▸ still very influential, had the right idea

# Classic Work on Parenting
 • Dianna Baumrind
    ◦ 4 styles of parenting
    ◦ 2 dimensions:
       ▸ parental responsiveness - how much do the parents pay attention to their kids wants and needs
       ▸ parental demandingness - how much do the parents ask of their kids
 • *Permissive* parenting
    ◦ high responsiveness, low demandingness
    ◦ doesn’t require/expect mature behaviour from kids
    ◦ warm and understanding
    ◦ give in to kids
    ◦ lets their kids do whatever they want
    ◦ “mediocre” outcomes
       ▸ don’t do particularly well academically
       ▸ kids don’t respect parents as much as you’d hope - they think their parents don’t care
 • *Uninvolved* parenting
    ◦ low responsiveness, low demandingness
    ◦ doesn’t expect mature behaviour
    ◦ doesn’t care what their kids do
    ◦ kids feel unloved, lost
 • *Authoritarian* parenting
    ◦ low responsiveness, high demandingness
    ◦ obedience and status oriented, might rely on punishment
    ◦ kids end up successful, but resentful that they couldn’t persue their own path
    ◦ kids feel like they don’t know who they are
 • *Authoritative* parenting
    ◦ high responsiveness, high demandingness
    ◦ most supportive style
    ◦ best outcomes in kids
    ◦ warm and understanding, but clear on limits
 • these are broad definitions
 • styles often change
    ◦ often less strict as kids get older

# Emerging Perspectives on Parenting
 • how has parenting changed?
    ◦ less children, on average
       ▸ therefore parents put more time per kid into their children
 • new research on pedagogy (teaching)
    ◦ kids being told what to do by their parents, at their activities (sports etc) - very structured
    ◦ teaching is also very structured
    ◦ teaching provides evidence about what causal relationships exist
    ◦ but also about what relationships do not exist

# Our Changing Perspectives
 • ageing populations
    ◦ what do we think about most when we consider ageing populations
       ▸ not enough babies
       ▸ increased resources necessary to care for older population
    ◦ cultural problem
       ▸ our culture is youth-oriented
    ◦ we are underprepared
 • what are the _biological_ hallmarks of ageing?
    ◦ diminishing senses
    ◦ cognitive disadvantages
    ◦ also cognitive advantages
       ▸ greater wisdom/expertise
 • what are the _psychological_ hallmarks of ageing
    ◦ positivity effect - “looking at the world through rose-coloured glasses”
       ▸ older people tend to remember more positive than negative information, compared to younger people
       ▸ older people think more about community and how they can help others, younger people are more focused on individual goals
