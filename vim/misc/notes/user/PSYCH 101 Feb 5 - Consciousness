PSYCH 101 Feb 5 - Consciousness

# Consciousness
 • many definitions
    ◦ tied to memory, sensation, perception, attention
    ◦ “subjective awareness”

# Sleep
 • sleep is still a big mystery in many aspects
 • supercharismatic nucleus
    ◦ part of visual system
    ◦ acts like a clock which controls sleep cycle
 • too much sleep can be bad
 • why do we sleep
    ◦ restore and repair hypothesis
       ▸ gives body a chance to recover from the day
       ▸ burned some rats, kept some of them sleep deprived
          ▹ sleepless rats healed slower
       ▸ sleep deprived humans (26 min/night)
          ▹ gave cognitive test of working memory - 38% deteriation after 4 days
    ◦ preserve and protect hypothesis
    ◦ information consolidation - memory
       ▸ people sleep to process info acquired during the day
       ▸ moves memories into long-term memory
       ▸ improves organization of memories, makes new connections

 • sleep disorders
    ◦ insomnia
       ▸ inability to go to sleep, stay sleeping, or go back to sleep
       ▸ feeds on itself - not sleeping makes you worry and keeps you up
       ▸ drug therapy for insomnia not very useful (sleeping pills etc)
          ▹ build tollerance quickly (< 4 weeks) and dependence (can’t sleep without it)
       ▸ onset insomnia - can’t go to sleep (most transient - comes and goes)
       ▸ maintenance insomnia - can’t stay asleep
       ▸ primary insomnia - insomnia on its own, doesn’t seem to be another factor causing it
       ▸ secondary insomnia - side effect of another disorder
    ◦ nightmares - rarely a disorder
    ◦ night terrors - usually occur in older children, during non-REM sleep, causes intense panic
 • narcolepsy - involuntary sleep
 • hypnosis - see text
