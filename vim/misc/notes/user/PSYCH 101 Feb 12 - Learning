PSYCH 101 Feb 12 - Learning

# Behaviorism
 • the attempt to understand observable activity in terms of observable stimuli and observable responses
 • John B. Watson (1913)
 • B.F. Skinner (1938)

# Classical Conditioning
 • Pavlov’s dogs
    ◦ investigating digestive reflexes and salvation of dogs when eating different foods
    ◦ found that dogs started salivating before he even gave them food (psychic secretion)
       ▸ due to classical conditioning - the dogs knew that when he started setting up the lab, they’d get food
    ◦ neutral stimulus (bell rinigng) → no reaction
    ◦ unconditioned stimulus (eating food) → reflex reaction (salivation)
    ◦ neutral + unconditioned (bell rings when you get food) → reflex reaction (salivation)
    ◦ conditioned stimulus (bell ringing without food) → conditioned reaction (salivation)
 • Phenomenon
    ◦ extinction - suppression of conditioned response (bell stops causing salivation after a while if they never get food)
    ◦ spontaneous recovery - seems like conditioned response is extinct, but some time later, the conditioned stimulus works
    ◦ generalization - similar stimulus causes same response (bell → telephone ringing)
    ◦ discrimination training - distinguishing between general stimulus by only providing unconditioned stimulus with the desired stimulus
 • Food-aversion
    ◦ is it classical conditioning?
       ▸ with c.c., unconditional stimulus is usually provided at the same time as the neutral stimulus
          ▹ bell rings, dog gets food
       ▸ food poisoning has a bigger time gap
          ▹ eat a bad meal, later in the day feel sick
          ▹ if you feel sick right after eating something, you usually assume it *isn’t* the food
 • Food preference learning
    ◦ rat & thiamin experiment
       ▸ rats instinctively ate the one food sample that contained thiamin when they were low on it
 • Food selection
    ◦ 35 wk old babies (past breastfeeding) were presented with a tray of healthy foods, but no item had all the needed neutrients
    ◦ babies developed preferences, but preferences varied over time
    ◦ in the long run, they ate balanced diets

# Operant Conditioning
 • a.k.a. instrumental conditioning
 • +/- reinforcement
    ◦ when you want subject to do more of a behaviour
    ◦ + mom gives candy to kid for finishing homework → kid does homework more often
    ◦ - mom nags when kid doesn’t do dishes → kid does dishes
 • +/- punishment
    ◦ when you want subject to stop a behaviour
    ◦ + speeding b/c you’re late for work, get a speeding ticket → don’t speed again (punishment by doing something the subject doesn’t like)
    ◦ - siblings fighting over TV, parents take away TV privleges → don’t fight over TV again (punishment by taking away something the subject likes)
 • reinforcement schedules
    ◦ Fixed-Interval - reinforce after a set amount of time has passed
    ◦ Fixed-Ratio - reinforce after a set number of responses
    ◦ Variable-Interval - reinforce around but not exactly the same time period
    ◦ Variable-Ratio - reinforce after around but not exactly the same number of responses
    ◦ Conditioning with a variable schedule is less likely to experience extinction

# Classical vs Operant Conditioning
                        | Classical              | Operant

  Stimulus onset        | stimulus precedes      | stimulus follows response
                        | response and elicts it | and strenthens it

  Type of response      | elicted responses      | emitted responses

  Learning results from | association            | consequences
                 
  Person                | Pavlov                 | Skinner/Thorndike

# Observational Learning
 • learning by example
 • Bandura’s cognitive theory
    ◦ people observe the behaviour of other people to gain knowledge about what people do
    ◦ attention - learner has to perceive and be interested by subject
    ◦ memory - learner has to remember information obtained
    ◦ motor control - learner has to be able to replicate observed behaviour
    ◦ motivation - learner has to have some reason to want to learn the behaviour
 • over-imitation
    ◦ learner is watching someone perform a task; the model performs extraneous actions that aren’t needed to achieve the end result
    ◦ human learners will replicate all the unnecessary tasks
       ▸ however, could be cultural influences - “this is how we as a people do this task”
    ◦ animal learners will immediately perform the action that does the desired result
 • Learning in school
    ◦ need to be motiviated (often by testing/examination)
    ◦ can’t be too easy

# Learning Disablilities
 • distinct learning styles - not just “stupid”
 • specific impairments - to thinking, seeing, hearing, remembering, learning
 • severity - many different levels
 • duration - (usually) doesn’t go away, people just figure out how to learn with their disability
 • origins - bad parenting (no longer accepted), genetics
 • in school:
    ◦ student is in class, but there is a support staff/specialist
       ▸ however, support staff aren’t there very much
    ◦ movement towards students and parents being more involved with academics
