PSYCH 101 Jan 29 - Sensation and Perception

# Demos
 • Inattentional blindness - you don’t notice things if you’re not paying attention to them
    ◦ (or if you’re closely paying attention to something else)
    ◦ Bouncing ball demo
       ▸ animation of 3 people bouncing a basketball, overlayed with slapping hands
       ▸ asked to count how many times the ball bounces
       ▸ at one point, the slapping hands shake hands instead
       ▸ most people don’t notice this because they’re focused on counting the balls
    ◦ ambiguous figures
       ▸ people are much more likely to see one figure over another depending on priming/stimulus before hand

# Sensation
 • sensation
    ◦ the basic processes by which sensory organs and the nervous system respond to sitmuli in the environment and the basic psychological experiences that result from that
 • psychophysics
    ◦ physical characteristics of stimuli + our sensory experience
 • important concepts
    ◦ thresholds - what is the threshold where we start to notice stimuli
       ▸ increasing frequency of audio tones, increasing intensity of light etc
       ▸ absolute threshold - the point of intensity at which a person can just detect the presence of the stimulus
          ▹ aka “detection threshold”
          ▹ need 50% people able to detect it
       ▸ difference threshold - smallest detectable difference between two stimuli of different intensities
          ▹ aka “just-noticible difference” (jnd)
          ▹ again, need 50% people able to tell the difference

# Senses and Sensory Receptors
 • transduction - physical stimulation causes electrical changes in your cells
 • receptor cells
    ◦ smell - olfactory receptor cells
    ◦ taste - taste receptor cells on taste buds
    ◦ pain - A-delta fibers, C fibers
    ◦ hearing - cilia (hair cells) in inner ear

# Sensory Adaptation
 • when we get used to a stimulus
 • we are better suited to sense _changes_ more than _stagnation_
    ◦ ex: smell of strong perfume, loud music, bright lights
       ▸ bad at first, but you get used to it

# Senses
 • smell
    ◦ functions
       ▸ detecting important environmental changes
          ▹ fire (smell smoke)
       ▸ recognition
          ▹ siblings, offspring
          ▹ not as much in humans as in other species
       ▸ infant bonding
       ▸ mate selection
          ▹ “major histocompatibility complex” (MHC molecules) play an important role in immune system
    ◦ how smell works
       ▸ stimuli trigger different glomeruli, which send signals to limbic system and hypothalamus, and eventually to temporal and frontal lobes
       ▸ molecules evaporate from source and enter nasal canal, dissolve in mucus and are detected
 • taste
    ◦ functions
       ▸ what to eat or not to eat
    ◦ how taste works
       ▸ 50-100 receptor cells per taste bud
       ▸ each cell detects a specific taste and is tied to a specific part of the brain
       ▸ more taste buds = more sensitivity (esp. bitter)
       ▸ temporal and parietal lobes, frontal lobe
       ▸ 80% of the perception of taste actually comes from smell
 • pain
    ◦ somatosense - can originate from many places throughout your body
       ▸ soma - body
       ▸ feels as if its coming from inside us (usually)
    ◦ pain receptors
       ▸ A-delta fibers - thicker, myelinated, faster
          ▹ first wave of pain
          ▹ responds to strong pressure, extereme temperatures
          ▹ causes instinctive response to move away from source of pain
          ▹ spinal reflex - react before signal even reaches brain
       ▸ C fibers - thinner, unmyelinated, slower
          ▹ lingering pain, deters future interaction with source of pain
