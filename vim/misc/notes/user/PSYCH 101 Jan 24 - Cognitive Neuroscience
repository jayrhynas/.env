# Types of Research
 • behavioural - what can people do?
 • neurological - where and how does it happen (in your brain)?
 • ways to measure brain activity:
    ◦ EEG cap
       ▸ high temporal resolution
       ▸ low spacial resolution
    ◦ FMRI
       ▸ low temporal resolution
       ▸ high spacial resolution
 • brain changing over time
    ◦ what changes in your brain as you age?
       ▸ unhealthy vs healthy ageing
    ◦ how do babies’ brains develop?
 • animal research
    ◦ use experiments on animals to inform human studies
       ▸ still have high ethical standards for animal experimentation
 • human lesion studies
    ◦ what was injured?
    ◦ how does it affect how you behave?

# The Brain’s Lobes
 • frontal lobe
    ◦ sense of time
       ▸ last to develop in children
    ◦ motor skills
 • parietal lobe
    ◦ sensory
    ◦ “assoication center” - combines senses into
 • occipital lobe
    ◦ vision
 • temporal lobe
    ◦ sound
    ◦ memory
    ◦ recognizing objects

# Spacial Neglect
 • brain injury on one side of the brain affects bodily functions on the other side
 • attentional deficit - subject doesn’t pay attention to sensory input (esp. vision)
 • common with injury to right parietal lobe
 • “common cold of neurological disorders”
 • memory is not destroyed, but subject ignores left side of them
    ◦ ask them to remember walking down a street, they can only name the shops on the right
    ◦ but ask them to turn around and walk down the other way, they can remember the other shops (which are now on their right)
 • burning house experiment
    ◦ neglected information is possibly still absorbed and considered at a subconcious level

# Traumatic Brain Injuries
 • aka concussion
 • usually a _closed_ brain injury
 • little to no loss of consciousness
 • damage at cellular level, hard to detect
 • *TBIs are cumulative*
 • symptoms
    ◦ fatigue
    ◦ headaches
    ◦ irritability
 • Junior Seau
    ◦ NFL player
    ◦ 20 years of cumulative brain damage
    ◦ committed suicide
