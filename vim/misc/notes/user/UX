# Market vs User Research
 - Market
    - Who? How much? Why?
    - Focuses on groups of users, goal is to determine if service is viable in marketplace
 - User
    - What? How? When?
    - About individual experience, goal is to identify problems and solutions the user will experience
    - Important to know what works and what doesn’t

# UX Tests
 - Debrief: talk to user after test, ask about their overall experience, 3 best/worst moments etc
 - Usability study
    - Most accurate and in-depth study of user’s experience
    - One user at a time, non-specific tests
    - Collect & analyze data, debrief
 - Diary study
    - Collect data over long periods of use
    - Users record video diaries talking about their feelings about the experience
    - 1-3 times/week
    - Encourage discussion of specific tasks
    - Collect & analyze data, debrief
 - A/B testing
    - Compares two implementations of a new feature
    - One user at a time, specific tasks, collect & analyze data, debrief
 - Field study

    - Intend to simulate natural experience

# UX Testing Tips
 - Small samples (5 or less), but often
 - Focus on fixing majority complaints first, individual problems later
 - Let user take the wheel
 - Good feedback is as important as bad feedback
 - Less is more _usable_

# Stakeholder involvement
 - Stakeholders: anyone directly affected by success of product/project
 - Important for stakeholders to pay attention to user & market research
 - Know what your stakeholders want, encourage participation and observation of studies
 - Create interesting ways to showcase results

# Impact & Lean Design
 - Success of research is judged by impact on design
 - Doesn’t limit creativity, only parameters
 - Successful research leads to *lean design*
 - Lean UX
    - combines principles of lean startup with design
