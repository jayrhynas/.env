# newline-fix.bash: Force the bash prompt to start after a newline
# http://snippets.scripts.mit.edu/gitweb.cgi/.git/blob/HEAD:/bash/newline-fix.bash
#
# Some commands don't print a newline at the end of their output, or
# take long enough to return that you've already typed part of the
# next command.  Either causes bash to start its prompt in the middle
# of a line, which confuses it.  This script sets $PROMPT_COMMAND to
# echo a magic sequence of terminal commands that will display a red
# '<no LF>\n' before the prompt if it would otherwise start in the
# middle of a line.
